#MFSideMenu

This fork of MFSideMenu makes a few minor quick and dirty changes that suited some very specific visual and behavioural requirements of a project. It is unlikely to be of use to anyone else.

In this project the container was set up in an unorthodox way. That is, with a nil leftMenuViewController, the main content area in the rightMenuController, and the side menu as the centerViewController. The menu width was then set to the screen width and the result was a side menu that came out from the left. Some extra considerations needed to be made such as closing the menu via the (now rather unintuitive) setting of the menu state of MFSideMenuStateRightMenuOpen.
